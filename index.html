                Hi reader, thanks for visiting my site. Without overwhelming you, here is a short introduction... My
                full
                name is Khoa Anh Nguyen and I am 24 years old. Born in Vietnam, my family and I came here in 1995 when I
                was
                super young (just over a year old). Since then, I have pretty much lived in Seattle my entire life. I
                love
                it here. After highschool, I decided to take my talents to the East Coast where I attended college at
                Davidson College in North Carolina where I graduated with a BS in Biology.
                Upon graduating, I moved back home and took up a job in environmental consulting.
            </p>

            <p>
                It was soon thereafter that I started having a quarter-life crisis.
                I realized I wanted to work for myself. Working for other people and having to answer clients was
                clearly
                not working out.
                My hope with this bootcamp is to learn and build out my own idea. I mean, what can be cooler than having
                your own startup?
            </p>
